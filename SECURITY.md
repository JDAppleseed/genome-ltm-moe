# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, please report it by emailing `security@example.com` with a clear description and reproduction steps. We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours.

## Scope
This repository is a research scaffold and should not be used in production. Vulnerabilities should still be reported so we can fix documentation or example artifacts that may mislead users.
