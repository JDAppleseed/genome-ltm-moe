# Risk controls & clinical research boundary

## Safety boundary
This project is limited to:
- interpretation
- uncertainty quantification
- disease mechanism hypothesis generation
- evidence fusion

It does NOT provide instructions for genome modification.

## Controls
- Abstention-first design under uncertainty
- Audit trails for evidence
- No "design/edit genome" features
- Human review required for any medical claims
- Privacy-by-design guidance for handling human data
